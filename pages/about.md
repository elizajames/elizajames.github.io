## About

I am an archivist and maker of sundry digital and analog things. In my current position, I do a little bit of everything: digital preservation, data wrangling, repository management, teaching, metadata creation, data consultations, collections processing, digitization, and community outreach. This site features select materials I've created in the course of this work. All resources are freely available for reuse under a [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0) License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/).

My scholarship focuses on using cultural heritage metadata as data for teaching, discovery, and research; non-traditional forms of engagement with digital archival materials; and scalable approaches to digital preservation and repository management for small and medium size institutions. Iâ€™m interested in a little bit of everything related to archives, technology, and how technology can facilitate access to library and archives resources in both positive and negative ways. I'm particularly interested in how technology can help leverage digitized and digital cultural heritage materials to further scholarship, discovery, and use of cultural heritage materials.

As an archivist in Appalachia, I care about increasing access and decreasing inequity in archives and libraries. If you like those things too, [let's talk](mailto:elizabeth.danyel.james@gmail.com)!
