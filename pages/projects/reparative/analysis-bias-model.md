## Bias-Aware Archives Model

The following model was an early iteration of the Bias-Aware Archives Model that was presented at the 2021 Appalachian Studies Association. Though this version of the model did begin to delve into the full lifecycle of bias within archival work, it was focused almost entirely on the archive to the exclusion of the true intended focus: the creators of records, the actions the archive takes, and how all of these actions intersect with those of creators and users of records.

The second iteration of the seeks to communicate an action-oriented sense of the overlap between the use of archival records as well as the actions taken by various users (including non-creators, creators, and archivists). These actions are where bias can creep into archival work. In the Impact on Archival Practice page I expand upon the actions outlined in the model and discuss ways in which bias can be combatted.
