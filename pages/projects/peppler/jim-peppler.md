# Visualizing the Jim Peppler _Southern Courier_ Collection

## Introduction

Published between 1965 and 1968 in Montgomery, Alabama, the _Southern Courier_ was a weekly newspaper that focused on Civil Rights issues in America. James H. "Jim" Peppler was the primary photographer for the newspaper and donated the negatives and slides he took during his tenure to the Alabama Department of Archives and History. In 2013, the Alabama Department of Archives and History digitized 13,341 images from the Jim Peppler _Southern Courier_ Collection and the original images can be found on the [Alabama Department of Archives and History website](https://digital.archives.alabama.gov/digital/collection/peppler).

The Jim Peppler _Southern Courier_ photos depict 530 identified individuals, 52 places, and 199 subjects, and this exhibit is composed of data visualizations that seek to make the thousands of photos more discoverable and accessible. Most visualizations will also link to the original photos at the Alabama Department of Archives and History.
