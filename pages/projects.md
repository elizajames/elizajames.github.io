## Projects

### 2022

[Born Digital, Audiovisual, and Digitized Materials Manual for Archives & Manuscripts Collections at WVU](https://elizajames.github.io/digital-preservation-documentation/)
This site outlines procedures, principles, and standards used for accessioning, appraising, accessioning, ingesting, processing, describing, stewarding, preserving, digitizing, and making accessible, digitized and born digital special collections and archival materials at the West Virginia and Regional History Center. 

### 2021

[Visualizing the Jim Peppler Southern Courier Collection](https://elizajames.github.io/jim_peppler.html)
The 13,471 photos from the Jim Peppler Southern Courier Collection depict 530 identified individuals, 52 places, and 199 subjects. This exhibit is composed of data visualizations that seek to make the thousands of photos more discoverable and accessible.

[Using Metadata as Data for Reparative Archival Description](https://elizajames.github.io/reparative.html)
Archivists and librarians rely on classification systems, controlled vocabularies, and processing approaches that prioritize certain perspectives while erasing others. As a result, it is critical that the field examine metadata creation and descriptive practices frequently, critically, and iteratively using all techniques at our disposal. This site discusses a case study in which one mid-sized institution explores the issues inherent in approaching reparative archival description from a metadata as data standpoint.

[First Year Seminar - Digital Archives Course Materials](https://elizajames.github.io/fys.html) 
This site contains materials developed for the FYS 100 course themed around "digital archives" taught by Elizabeth James at Marshall University in Spring 2021.

### 2020

The Francis H. Pierpont Civil War Telegrams, held at West Virginia University, document the Civil War period in the “Loyal” or “Restored” Government of Virginia that remained in the Union while the eastern portion of Virginia seceded. This site analyzes the circa 850 telegrams using data visualization and computational methods.
